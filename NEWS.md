## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the code to use "TRUE" instead of "T" and "FALSE" instead of "F". Additionally, any usage of "T" as a variable name is replaced with "T_", both in function documentation, and the source code

* All references now include a doi or arXiv URL, enclosed in angle brackets "<...>"

# desla 0.1.0

* First published version of the package
