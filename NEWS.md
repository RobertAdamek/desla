# desla 0.1.0.9000

* Added the function HDLP_state_dependent, which allows for estimation of impulse responses in different states, and also an option to estimate them with OLS rather than desparsified lasso, using the same long-run variance estimator.

* Fixed bug in the long run covariance function, which occasionally caused crashes

# desla 0.1.0 (commit 3b0833b)

* First published version of the package
